 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; There are probably no greater blessings than being born with zero health issues, but one must not take their good health for granted. There are very few people who understand that riches in terms of wealth would mean nothing if their health is on the line.

Illnesses occur for many reasons and sometimes help us build our immunity as well. But many times, these illnesses can also turn fatal or harm us in an unrecoverable way. Therefore we must treat our body like a holy temple and invest time and energy behind your physical and mental health.

<img id="img2" src="health.jpg">
 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMental &nbsp;&nbsp; health is also responsible for many deaths, and we often forget to take care of it and are scared to seek help because of some stupid reason. But we must not do that to seek help at the earliest possible condition will give the doctor time and give you enough time for a slow recovery. Living shouldn’t just be about existing or surviving, instead of for living correctly, one needs to follow a healthy lifestyle.

A healthy lifestyle necessarily doesn’t mean we have to give up on the delicious junk food; rather, it about us understanding how bad it is for you and finding healthier alternatives for the food to enjoy. A balanced diet will have all those components like water, protein, carbohydrate, etc. in the right quantity that our body needs to become healthier. A healthy diet will also help you have disease-free health and life.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;#4 Better Blood Circulation
Better blood circulation
Blood circulation begins to improve as you play sports. By running or taking part in other physical activities the body remains well-oxygenated. Thus, you stay more healthy and active.

This extra load strengthens your heart muscles which improve the overall flow of blood. Regular aerobic exercise increases the capillary density of working muscles in a healthy way. Aerobics also increases the mitochondrial count in the fibers of working muscles. Your heart starts to function better, resulting in a better heart pumping rate. The overall result is that you can exercise harder under less stress.
